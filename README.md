Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an aspiring AI/ML developer with a strong foundation in machine learning principles and a growing portfolio of hands-on projects. I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative AI teams and collaborate on impactful solutions.

### 🎯 What I bring to the table:
- 📚 Solid understanding of ML algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation
- 🧠 Experience with Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- 🔍 Passion for solving real-world problems through intelligent systems
- 🛠️ Currently building modular ML components for scalable deployment

### 🌱 What I'm learning:
- Advanced deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
- MLOps and model lifecycle management
- Responsible AI and fairness in machine learning

### 🤝 What I'm looking for:
- Internship or junior roles in AI/ML development
- Open-source collaborations with experienced mentors
- Teams focused on ethical, inclusive, and cutting-edge AI solutions

### 😄 Pronouns:
She/her

### ⚡ Fun fact:
I built a GenAI chatbot that not only answers questions—but also throws in dad jokes when it senses the user’s getting bored. It’s basically a stand-up comedian with a neural net 😄
